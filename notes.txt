  MORNING:
    - exported data to csv
    - built initial file structure for problem exploration
    - wrote function to strip html
      - also strips any formulas with <w, x> format
    - wrote function to read csv, apply names
    - wrote function to return dataframe w/o html

  AFTERNOON:
    - collapsed dataframe into single record with both question and answer text
    - Performed topic modeling with LDA, LSI and NMF
      - Discovered that many of my flashcards have error messages due to the export from anki, due to latex not being installed
    - attempting to resolve latex issues with anki to see if i can get a clean import
      - resolved latex issue related to bad data export
    - Currently, there are about 4200 unique words
    - Switched from CountVectorizer to TfidfVectorizer
      - set max document frequency to 80% to drive down commonly occurring words
    - attempting to remove commonly occurring latex words
      - exploring word counts in TfidfVectorizer
      - creating wordcloud function so I can see prominent (and meaningless) words
        - generated wordclouds for raw text and for text after removing html

  MORNING:
    - consider removing \item, \begin, \end, and other document formatting tags, but not other math-meaningful latex
      - removed item, generated wordcloud
      
NEXT:  Build cleaner to remove latex tags, put in preclean, generate another wordcloud

THEN: look over pipeline notebook from Chris
