Hominoids and Hominids	Hominoid is a subgroup of primates. They have smaller prains, they are quadupeds walking on all four but with flexible limbs<div>Hominids are human like. They walked ontwo feet. The hands are evolved to make tools.&nbsp;</div>
Where did Hominids originate	Africa. 5.6 MYA fossil of Australopithecus was found there and no fossil outside Africa is more than 1.8 mya
Distinctive features of Hominids	Large Brain Size, Upright posture, bipedal motion and &nbsp;specialisation of hands
What are two divisions of Hominids	Australopithecus and Homo
Difference b/w Australopithecus and Homo	Former has smaller brain large jaw size and larger teethe
What are different species of Homo	homo habilis the tool maker<div>Homo erectus the upright man</div><div>Homo Sapiens the wise or thinking man</div><div>All of them migrated.&nbsp;</div><div>Homo Neanderthalensis. they occupied europe and western and central asia from 13000 to 35000 years ago</div><div>Smaller jaws were because of difference in dietary habits because of use of fire for cooking</div>
Development of Language	<div>Among living beings, it is humans alone that have a language. There</div><div>are several views on language development: (1) that hominid language</div><div>involved gestures or hand movements; (2) that spoken language was</div><div>preceded by vocal but non-verbal communication such as singing or</div><div>humming; (3) that human speech probably began with calls like the</div><div>ones that have been observed among primates. Humans may have</div><div>possessed a small number of speech sounds in the initial stage.</div><div>Gradually, these may have developed into language</div><div><div>When did spoken language emerge? It has been suggested that the</div><div>brain of Homo habilis had certain features which would have made it</div><div>possible for them to speak. Thus, language may have developed as</div><div>early as 2 mya. The evolution of the vocal tract was equally important.</div><div>This occurred around 200,000 years ago. It is more specifically</div><div>associated with modern humans.</div><div>A third suggestion is that language developed around the same</div><div>time as art, that is, around 40,000-35,000 years ago. The development</div><div>of spoken language has been seen as closely connected with art, since</div><div>both are media for communication</div></div>
Altamira	Cave site in spain<div><br /></div>
Name some sites where cave paintings have been found	<div>Hundreds of paintings of animals (done between 30,000 and12,000</div><div>years ago) have been discovered in the caves of Lascaux and Chauvet,</div><div>both in France, and Altamira, in Spain. These include depictions of</div><div>bison, horses, ibex, deer, mammoths, rhinos, lions, bears, panthers,</div><div>hyenas and owls</div>
What were environmental conditions in which Farming developed	<div>The last ice age came to an end about 13,000 years ago and with</div><div>that warmer, wetter conditions prevailed. As a result, conditions were</div><div>favourable for the growth of grasses such as wild barley and wheat. At</div><div>the same time, as open forests and grasslands expanded, the population</div><div>of certain animal species such as wild sheep, goat, cattle, pig and</div><div>donkey increased. What we find is that human societies began to</div><div>gradually prefer areas that had an abundance of wild grasses and</div><div>animals. Now relatively large, permanent communities occupied such</div><div>areas for most parts of the year. With some areas being clearly preferred,</div><div>a pressure may have built up to increase the food supply. This may</div><div>have triggered the process of domestication of certain plants and</div><div>animals. It is likely that a combination of factors which included climatic</div><div>change, population pressure, a greater reliance on and knowledge of a</div><div>few species of plants (such as wheat, barley, rice and millet) and animals</div><div>(such as sheep, goat, cattle, donkey and pig) played a role in this</div><div>transformation.</div>
