Parametric versus nonparametric models Machine learning algorithms can be grouped into parametric and nonparametric models. Using parametric models, we estimate parameters from the training dataset to learn a function that can classify new data points without requiring the original training dataset anymore. Typical examples of parametric models are the perceptron, logistic regression, and the linear SVM. In contrast, nonparametric models can't be characterized by a fixed set of parameters, and the number of parameters grows with the training data. Two examples of nonparametric models that we have seen so far are the decision tree classifier/random forest and the kernel SVM.<br><br>KNN belongs to a subcategory of nonparametric models that is described as instance-based learning. Models based on instance-based learning are characterized by memorizing the training dataset, and lazy learning is a special case of instance-based learning that is associated with no (zero) cost during the learning process.

(RM)ANCOVA:&nbsp;<i>Example </i>– SPSS <img src="Bildschirmfoto 2017-10-18 um 10.30.23.png" /><div>If A1 and A2 are compared for the three groups:</div><div><img src="Bildschirmfoto 2017-10-18 um 10.30.59.png" /></div><div>A2 = 1.5 * A1, so A1 already explains 100% of the variance of A2. This is what makes ANCOVA unique among all repeated measures test. Using any other method to analyse this data, the absolute difference between measurements would be tested similar to how matched pairs t-test and ANOVA did it, and it would conclude that scores increase in general, and that group 3 increases more than the other groups.</div><div><br /></div><div>ANCOVA isn’t limited to the difference scores (A2 – A1), but it is allowed to freely change the weight of A1 to best estimate A2 (A2 – 1.5*A1), so all variance in A2 can already be explained by A1 and all change scores, including the differences between groups, disappear. This will happen as long as change scores are proportional, and ANCOVA is the only method that takes that into account.</div><div><br /></div><div><img src="Bildschirmfoto 2017-10-18 um 10.57.05.png" /></div><div><div>Thanks to the first two cases (5-6 &amp; 5-8), there is still a little unexplained variance in the model. However, again all differences been groups have already been explained by the pre-measurement. The matched pairs t-test was significant as the post-measurement was 2 points higher on average, but the ANCOVA doesn’t care about that and just explains what it can with the pre-measurement, including that main effect of time. ANCOVA only measures the interaction effect well, and as every group increased by 2 on average, there is no interaction effect, hence SS Group = 0.</div><div><br /></div><div>The significance of B1 shows that there is a very strong linear relationship between B1 and B2. Given that these are a pre-measurement and post-measurement, you’d expect this relationship to be at least decent.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><img src="Bildschirmfoto 2017-10-18 um 10.57.53.png" /></div><div>Now, the differences are a little random, so both the covariate and the groups are now significant. This means the differences weren’t proportional like with A, or equal like with B, but that there really is a (more random) difference in how the groups changed over time. This means we can use multiple comparisons as a follow-up analysis to find exactly where these groups differ that can’t just be explained away by the pre-measurement.</div><div><img src="Bildschirmfoto 2017-10-18 um 10.58.07.png" /></div><div><img src="Bildschirmfoto 2017-10-18 um 11.00.16.png" /></div><div>Unlike the ANOVA for Gain scores previously, the means in the “Estimates” table aren’t the difference scores, but the adjusted means of the post-measurement after correcting for the pre- measurement. Though also in this case, all the general conclusions remain the same, though ANCOVA is probably more accurate given that any bias between groups due to differences on the pre-measurement is removed.</div><div><br /></div><div>Group 3 has the highest adjusted mean of all groups, having a significantly higher mean than group 1 (.005) and group 2 (.023). The means we see are the means on the post-measurement after being corrected for the pre-measurement, so while the mean itself represents their score on the post- measurement, their differences are completely due to differences in change over time, as they all use “19.2” (shown right below the “Estimates” table) as a pre-measurement score. Group 1 and 2 don’t seem to differ significantly (.216).</div>

How would you handle an imbalanced dataset? An imbalanced dataset is when you have, for example, a classification test and 90% of the data is in one class. That leads to problems: an accuracy of 90% can be skewed if you have no predictive power on the other category of data! Here are a few tactics to get over the hump:<br>1- Collect more data to even the imbalances in the dataset.<br>2- Resample the dataset to correct for imbalances.<br>3- Try a different algorithm altogether on your dataset.<br>What's important here is that you have a keen sense for what damage an unbalanced dataset can cause, and how to balance that.

Multiway Frequency Models: <i>df</i> <div>For the degrees of freedom of this model, we need to look closely at how the model is specified. We always start with the total number of cells, then always subtract 1 because at the very least, you are always aware of the total sample size of all groups.

Next, we need to subtract “number of groups – 1 = i – 1” for each main effect, “<b>(i – 1)(j – 1)</b>” for each twoway interaction, and “<b>(i – 1)(j – 1)(k – 1)</b>” for each threeway interaction, and so on.

What are residual plots? Since our model uses multiple explanatory variables, we can't visualize the linear regression line (or hyperplane to be precise) in a two-dimensional plot, but we can plot the residuals (the differences or vertical distances between the actual and predicted values) versus the predicted values to diagnose our regression model. Those residual plots are a commonly used graphical analysis for diagnosing regression models to detect nonlinearity and outliers, and to check if the errors are randomly distributed.

What are Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) graphs useful for? Selecting models for classification based on their performance with respect to the false positive and true positive rates, which are computed by shifting the decision threshold of the classifier. The diagonal of an ROC graph can be interpreted as random guessing, and classification models that fall below the diagonal are considered as worse than random guessing. A perfect classifier would fall into the top-left corner of the graph with a true positive rate of 1 and a false positive rate of 0. Based on the ROC curve, we can then compute the so-called area under the curve (AUC) to characterize the performance of a classification model.

Clustering a method of unsupervised learning - a good way of discovering unknown relationships in datasets.<br><br>Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data mining, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, and computer graphics.<br><br>Cluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm, but the general task to be solved. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their notion of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances among the cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions. Clustering can therefore be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter settings (including values such as the distance function to use, a density threshold or the number of expected clusters) depend on the individual data set and intended use of the results. Cluster analysis as such is not an automatic task, but an iterative process of knowledge discovery or interactive multi-objective optimization that involves trial and failure. It is often necessary to modify data preprocessing and model parameters until the result achieves the desired properties.
