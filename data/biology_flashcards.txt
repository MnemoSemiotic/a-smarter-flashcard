DFC	begins with dead matters.it is made up of decomposer (saprotrophs) which are heterotrophic organismeg fungi and bacteria <div style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px;'></div> 
how decomposers meet energy need	by degrading dead organic matteror detritus&nbsp; <div style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px;'></div> 
how decomposr degrade food material	they produce enzyme which breakdown dead and waste material &nbsp;into simple inorganic material ,which are subsequently absorbed &nbsp;by them <div style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px;'></div> 
in aquatic ecosystem which is the major conduit for energy	GFC <div style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px;'></div> 
in a terrestial the major conduit for energy is&nbsp;	DFC <div style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px;'></div>

Competitive release	A species restricted to a small geographical area due to superior ,expands &nbsp;its distributional range when the competitive species is experimentaly removed <div style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px;'></div> 
eg for competitive release	connell's field experiment rockyy sea coasrs of scotland the larger and compertitively superior barnacle Balanus dominates interridal area ,and excludes the smaller barnacle Chathamalus from the zone <div style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px;'></div> 
Gause's competitive exclusion principle	it states that two closely related species compering for the same resources cannot co exist indefinitely and the competitvely inferior one will be eliminated eventualy. <div style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px;'></div> 
Resource partitioning	if 2 species compete for the same resources they could avoid competition by choosing &nbsp;different times for feeding or different foraging pattern <div style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px;'></div> 
eg for resource partitioning	Macarthur &nbsp;warbler of same species can survive in same trees difference in foraging activities. <div style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px;'></div> 
Adaptation of parasites	loss of sense organs ,presence of adhesive organs,sucker to cling on to the host , loss of digestive system,high reproductive capacity. <div style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px;'></div> 
eg for parasites	human liver fluke depends on 2 intermediate hosts snail and fish<div>&nbsp;to complete its life cycle<div>malarial need mosquitoes.</div></div> <div style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px;'></div> 
ecto parasites	lice on humas and ticks on dogs,<div>cuscuta on hedge plants,lost its chlorophyl&nbsp;</div><div>femal mosquito need blood for reproduction but not parasite</div> <div style='font-family: Arial; font-size: 20px;'></div>

Contraction of sarcomere	The 'heads' of the thick myosin filament are attracted to points along the thin actin filament, but typically blocked by the tropomysin membrane. When a calcium ion shifts the tropomysin, the myosin can bond to the actin, and when ATP energizes the myosin, it can release and grip another point. Thus, the myosin brings the two sets of actin filaments closer together, making the distance between the Z lines smaller and thus contracting the sarcomere.&nbsp;

Filtrate that gets forced through spaces in the endothelial cells of capillary beds	lymph
As blood travels through capillaries the concentration of solutes in capillaries (increases or decreases)	Increases (lymph diffuses out)

Hydrostatic Pressure is (greater or lower) in latter part of capillaries	Lower
Lymphatic vessels dump their content back into blood circulation (T/F)	TRUE.&nbsp;
The location where lymph enters back into circulation	End of venous (vein) circulation. LOW PRESSURE
Lymph drains into (Low OR High) pressure portion of circulatory stystem	LOWWW
Lymphs have ___ to prevent backward flow	valves
Lymph vessels has smooth muscle to help direct forward flow (T/F)	True&nbsp;
Lymph vessels pick up materials at the ___	capillary beds
lymph re-enters at the ____ veins	subclavian
Lymph vessels take advantage of ___ muscle to move the lymph around the body	skeletal&nbsp;
Fluids in the lymph vessels are filtered in the ____ before entering back into the bloodstream	lymph nodes
Chylomicrons enter the (bloodstream OR lymphatic system)&nbsp;	Lymphatic!!- too big to enter capillaries
Chylomicrons are synthesized in the epithelial cells in our ___	small intestine
The lymphatic vessels of our small intestine are called ___	lacteals
Chylomicrons enter these lymphatic vessels	lacteals
Molecules that cannot diffuse directly into capillaries, enter ____ to then enter the bloodstream	lymphatic circulation
Lymphatic Vessels collect fluid forced out of the capillaries due to the high pressure in the arteries, and bring it back to bloodstream (T/F)	TTTTTTTT
The lymph has more proteins than blood &nbsp;(T/F)	False!!!!
As blood travels through the capillary the hydrostatic pressure (inc or dec) and the osmotic pressure (inc or dec)	Decreases, Increases
The measure of the tendency of a solution to take water in by osmosis	Osmotic Pressure
How much lymph do we make per day?	3 Liters!! (20 comes out of blood and 17 reenters through osmotic pressure)

What is the significance of the evolution of stomata?	Stomata are opening on the surface of plants that are not covered by cuticle. They provide a site for the movement of water into and out of the plant, and provide a site for gas exchange.
Do sporophytes develop from zygotes through mitosis or meiosis? Explain.	<div>Mitosis. The sporophyte is derived from the 2N zygote. The zygote is the result of the union of a</div><div>sperm (N) and an ovum (N). &nbsp;The zygote divided by mitosis to develop into a multicellular 2N sporophyte. &nbsp;</div>
<div>Why wouldn't a scientist automatically place a photosynthetic organism into the same</div><div>clade as land plants?</div>	Photosynthesis occurs in many other organisms. Like Algae
Why do nonvascular plants grow so close to the ground?	They lack the support structures (xylem and phloem) that allow vascular plants to grow vertically.
<div>Which of the following is a characteristic of a nonvascular plant?&nbsp;</div><div>Select one:</div><div>• xylem and phloem</div><div>• complex root systems&nbsp;</div><div>•&nbsp;photosynthetic structures</div><div>•&nbsp;flowering reproductive structures&nbsp;</div><div>•&nbsp;thick, waxy cuticle&nbsp;</div>	photosynthetic structures
<div>Mosses have a thin cuticle that offers very little protection against dehydration. Why is this a</div><div>beneficial trait for the moss?</div>	A thin cuticle allows mosses to absorb moisture from their environment.
What life cycle phase dominates the life of a nonvascular plant?	gametophyte
<div>During what phase of its life cycle does a seedless vascular plant spend most of its life?</div>	sporocyte
Gymnosperm diversity evolved in a geologic period marked by changing climate conditions. Why would anthropogenic climate change be a threat to gymnosperms now?	The changes to the environment being introduced by anthropogenic factors are happening at such a rapid rate: much faster than environmental changes that occurred in past geological time periods. If gymnosperms lack the adaptations to adjust to these rapid changes, those organism may suffer loses. &nbsp;
<div>Which innovations gave gymnosperms a selective advantage over the&nbsp;nonvascular and seedless vascular plants during the Permian period? (4)</div>	bark, seeds, needle-shaped leaves, greatly reduced gametophyte stage
Which structure of a pine is the immature male gametophyte?	one prothallial cell, one generative cell, and two tube cells...<div><br /></div><div>NOT:&nbsp;cone, seed, pollen grain, or the tree</div>
<div>By what mechanism is gymnosperm pollen usually carried from male pollen cones to the&nbsp;female ovule cones that contain the eggs?</div>	wind
Which trait has not contributed to the dominance of angiosperms in many ecosystems?	thick, desiccation-resistant leaves that persist year-round in temperate habitats
What is the most common function of an angiosperm's sepals?	They protect the petals and other organs during flower development.
Approximately when do scientists believe life originated on Earth?	4.2 Billion Years ago
<div>Which piece of evidence supports the idea that life originated in or near submarine hydrothermal</div><div>vents?</div>	Some of the microorganisms that appear to have evolved earliest still live in hydrothermal vents.
When the Murchison meteorite that landed in Australia was found to contain amino acids, how could scientists tell they had arrived with the meteorite rather than having contaminated it after it landed?	About half of the amino acids were D isomers and half were L isomers, whereas nearly all organic molecules on Earth are in the L configuration.
<div>Huntington's disease, a progressive nervous system disorder, is inherited as a dominant trait. The songwriter Woody Guthrie died of Huntington's disease. If he was heterozygous for the trait and his wife did not carry it, what was the probability that their</div><div>son would develop Huntington's disease? (make a punnet square)</div>	50%<div><br /></div>
If both parents are heterozygous for a trait, what is the probability that a given offspring of theirs will display the recessive trait? Assume the gene for the trait is not sex-linked. (make punnet square)	1/4
<div>For fruit flies, brown body color (B) is dominant to black body color (b). A brown fruit fly is crossed with a black fruit fly. Both flies are purebred. What will the offspring's</div><div>genotypes be? (make punnet square)</div>	all Bb
<div>During metaphase I, the tetrads are aligned at the metaphase plate. How does their arrangement influence genetic variation? What is this concept called?</div>	<div>The two sets of duplicated homologous chromosomes synapsis at metaphase I. The positioning of the two duplicated chromosomes on either side in the middle of the cell is independent assortment. The separation of the two sets of duplicated homologous chromosome is segregation. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
Explain how crossing over increases genetic variation.	Non-sister chromatids from homologous chromosomes exchange genetic information, usually at two or more locations per chromosome depending on the size.
Describe how independent assortment during meiosis increases genetic variation.	The random arrangement of chromosomes during metaphase I creates gametes that are genetically unique from one another.
Describe in order the four phases that occur during meiosis II.	prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, telophase II

pseudocoelomates	reduced fluid filled cavity not lined by epithelium&nbsp;(in bilaterians)
no body cavity&nbsp;(in bilaterians)	acoelomates
acoelomates	no body cavity&nbsp;(in bilaterians)
Segmentation characteristicas in bilaterians can be wrong... give an example	segmented &nbsp;worms were grouped with crustaceans and insects, but are actually its own phyla of Annelida
4 major groups of bilaterians that are recognized today are:	Xenacoelomorpha (some &nbsp;worms)<div>Lophotrochozoa / Spiralia (other worms, molluscs, moss &nbsp;animals)</div><div>Ecdysozoa (More &nbsp;worms, insects, crabs, spiders, etc.)</div><div>Deuterostomia (more worms! starfishs, urchins, tunicates, &nbsp;vertebrates)</div>

For example, the chemical hydrophobicity of the gas and membrane are important variables in determining how permeable the membrane will be to the gas.

Whatever the particular chemical nature of the gas and membrane, Fick's law states the intuitively intelligible notion that the rate of gasvdiffusion is proportional to the available surface area (A) while inversely proportional to the thickness of the membrane (T). The actual physical factor that actuates unidirectional diffusion of gas across a membrane is the difference in partial pressure of the gas across the membrane and this is captured in the ΔP variable; consequently, the diffusion rate is proportional to the size of the partial pressure gradient.

For example, the chemical hydrophobicity of the gas and membrane are important variables in determining how permeable the membrane will be to the gas. These considerations are generically packaged into the ""D"" variable which is typically determined empirically. Whatever the particular chemical nature of the gas and membrane, Fick's law states the intuitively intelligible notion that the rate of gasvdiffusion is proportional to the available surface area (A) while inversely proportional to the thickness of the membrane (T). The actual physical factor that actuates unidirectional diffusion of gas across a membrane is the difference in <span class=cloze>partial pressure</span> of the gas across the membrane and this is captured in the ΔP variable; consequently, the diffusion rate is proportional to the size of the partial pressure gradient. Although the variables of D, A, and T may be easily determined in controlled experimental settings, they are virtually impossible to mathematically determine for any individual's lung.
